NPCI
According to National Scolarship Portal (NSP) there are approx. 23 lakhs 
appli. that apply for scholarship(24-25) amount disbursed is around 2050 cr.
This is central level scholarships
When it comes to Telanagana state we don't have a single portal that gives this 
info however an article published in July 2025 reports that 1lk 20 k Telangana
students are awaiting scholarship/fee reimbursemant.

loss of not linking
1. direct monitary loss this no depends on various schemes 
2. indirect financial lost- students have to pay late fee which leds to 
heavy penalty and in some cases they lose seat as the fees was not paid
3. missed hostel and transport consation -
4. forced borrowing from lenders at higher interest
 eg if 1lk students miss 10k annually
because of DBT failure that 1k cr of aid effectively with
held

how this solution helps
1. it reduces delay of money coming in an a/c and reworks
2. it prevents exclusion from getting the amt in ac
3. it increases current onboarding
4. scalable and low cost
